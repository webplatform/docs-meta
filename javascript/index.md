==Summary==

JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web, enabling us to implement all kinds of powerful dynamic features.

The usage of JavaScript is not limited inside browsers. You can use it in server and console environments with [http://nodejs.org Node.js] or [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino Rhino].

== Background ==

JavaScript is the scripting language of the web, allowing you to add dynamic behaviour to web documents. It was originally used for simple DOM manipulation, style switching and animated effects, but in recent times it has become so much more, with the advent of powerful APIs through the HTML5 specification, and the popularity of 3rd party libraries and applications such as jQuery, Node.js and Backbone.js. 

* First version: The first official version of JavaScript was called LiveScript, and shipped in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995.
* Current stable version: JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript specification, published by Ecma international. [http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/ ECMAScript version 5.1] is seen as the current stable version. 
* Current and future work: ECMAScript version 6 is currently being worked on, but the development of JavaScript goes far beyond that. There are new APIs being worked on all the time, in places such as the [http://www.w3.org/html/wg/ W3C HTML working group], and new JavaScript libraries appear all the time, on places like [https://github.com/ Github].

==Contributing to the JavaScript technology==

The standardisation of the ECMAScript language is handled by ECMA TC39, and is called project harmony, see [http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts TC39 latest work]. The best place to go to find out more is the [http://www.ecmascript.org/dev.php ECMAScript development homepage].
