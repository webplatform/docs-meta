# WebPlatform Docs uploads

This folder contains all file uploads used in the docs pages.

The initial structure with numbers was how MediaWiki managed file uploads and ensure file paths are valid.

If you add contents, make sure you don't insert invalid characters such as spaces or non ascii in folder and file names you add.
