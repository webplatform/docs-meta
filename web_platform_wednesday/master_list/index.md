This is the master list of CSS properties that we are using to coordinate participation in [[Meta:web_platform_wednesday|our drive to Beta status]].

If you are looking for a task to work on, we ask that you first consider working on an article listed on the current  [[Meta:web_platform_wednesday|Web Platform Wednesdays]] page. This way, we can be systematic and ensure completeness, quality, and review. If you can't find anything there that interests you, then feel free to pick a task from this list, and contact one of the '''coordinators''' listed on [[Meta:web_platform_wednesday|Web Platform Wednesdays]], so they can add it to the list of work for this week. That way, we can make sure that all the tasks for that article get finished, and that you are properly credited.

If you are not a coordinator, please '''do not edit this page'''. If you have suggestions for improvements, please make a suggestion on the community mailing list, [mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org?subject=(Masterlist) public-webplatform@w3.org].
